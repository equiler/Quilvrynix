# Quilvrynix
Quilvrynix is a simple chat app designed for easy communication, connecting users with very slow connection speeds without tampering the experience.


- You can also receive messages from other platforms and send replies back respectfully. (Instagram, Discord, and end-to-end encrypted platforms may need adjustments to send and receive messages properly).
- Send files up to a gigabyte without any interruptions.
- Torrent file sharing is fully supported.
- The app uses 64-bit encryption and sophisticated algorithms to minimize the data sent; files are compressed and encrypted to ensure fast speeds even with slower connections.
- Stable data transactions ensure you won't lose any data, even if your connection drops or gets interrupted while sending.
